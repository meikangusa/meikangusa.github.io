**Hello Dr. Mei** 

   I am delighted to inform you that Mr. Kang Mei, me, successfully defended the Ph.D. dissertation. This is a milestone for me and for my whole family, and of course, my greatest achievement until now (maybe in my life). 
   
   To honor the past that made me who I am, I really want to say thank you all for stopping by in the best part of my life. More importantly, we will take a little from the past no matter where we go. However, we all take different life pathway in destiny and will keep growing. As Wait Disney wrote, we do not look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new thing. Now it is the best momment to move on.
   
   To my friends, all the best wishes and Fight on!
