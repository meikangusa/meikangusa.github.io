abstract: The research delved into the occurrence and dynamics of dissolved
  metals, specifically manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu), within the Jiulong River
  Estuary, South China, a medium-sized subtropical estuary. Our findings
  unveiled a nuanced seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved metals
  throughout the entire estuarine system. Notably, dissolved Mn concentrations
  peaked (~ 3.5 μM) in the upper estuary, diminishing sharply along the salinity
  gradient, with a modest rise in the middle estuary and outer Xiamen Bay. In
  the upper estuary, heightened concentrations of dissolved Mn occurred in
  spring due to augmented terrestrial particle inputs, followed by suboxically
  reductive releases; conversely, concentrations were low in summer, attributed
  to dilution from increased freshwater discharges and particle scavenging. In
  contrast, dissolved Cu exhibited differently, with elevated concentrations
  (29.2–37.5 nM) in the upper and middle estuaries, driven by reductive
  dissolution of Mn particles and chloride-induced ion exchanges, respectively.
  Concurrently, heightened inputs of nutrients and metals correlated with
  elevated phytoplankton productivity (indicated by chlorophyll a) in the upper
  and outer estuary regions. Our analysis underscored the sensitivity of
  dissolved metals to environmental parameters, including temperature, pH, and
  dissolved oxygen. The integration of compiled historical data underscored the
  dynamic nature of dissolved metals, particularly Cu, in response to
  geochemical processes.The elevated ion levels indicated intensified ion
  releases from particles and sediments, attributable to increased anthropogenic
  perturbation and climatic changes (e. g. ocean warming).
