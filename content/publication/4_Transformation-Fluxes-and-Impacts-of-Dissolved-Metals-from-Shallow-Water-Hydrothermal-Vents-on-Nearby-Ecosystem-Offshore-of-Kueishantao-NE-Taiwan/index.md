abstract: Hydrothermal vents are one of the important sources of major or trace
  elements in the ocean. The elemental fluxes, however, may be dynamic due to
  coastal processes and hydrothermal  plumes, especially in shallow-water
  hydrothermal vents. We collected water samples by using the  trace-metal clean
  technique inside and outside two shallow-water hydrothermal vents (white
  vent  low temperature, high pH; and yellow vent high temperature, low pH) off
  Kueishantao Islet, Taiwan,  China via SCUBA divers. We analyzed these samples
  for their hydro-chemical parameters and  dissolved elements (Fe, Mn, Mg, V,
  Cu, and Mo) thereafter. Our results show that dissolved metals’ concentrations
  were significantly different between the two vents, with higher Mn and Fe in
  the White  Vent than in the Yellow Vent, likely due to the decreased affinity
  of the dissolved metals for particles  in the white vent. We estimated the
  plume fluxes of dissolved metals from the hydrothermal mouth  by multiplying
  in situ hydrothermal discharge flowrates with metals’ concentrations inside
  the vents,  which were 1.09~7.02 × 10^4 kg Mg, 0.10~1.23 kg Fe, 0.08~28 kg Mn,
  33.4~306 g V, 2.89~77.7 g Cu, and 54.3~664 g Mo, annually. The results further
  indicate that such plumes probably have impacted  nearby seawater due to
  coastal currents and particle desorption during transport. Furthermore,  the
  concentrations of biogenic elements could be further modified in seawater, and
  potentially  impact nearby ecosystems on a larger scale. Our study provides
  information with which to further  understand metal redeployment in submarine
  shallow nearby ecosystems.
