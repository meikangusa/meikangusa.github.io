abstract: GRSP is widely distributed in coastal wetlands, and there is a
  tendency for it to degrade with increasing burial depth. However, the dynamic
  changes in the chemical composition and stability of GRSP during the burial
  process are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify the
  chemical composition and accumulation characteristics of GRSP during the
  burial process in the Zhangjiang estuary. In a field study, soil cores to the
  depth of 100 cm were collected in the estuary from mangrove forests dominated
  by Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, and from mudflat. The results showed
  that the concentration of GRSP in mangrove forest soil was significantly
  higher than that in the mudflat (p < 0.05), and the C/N ratio of GRSP
  increased with depth at all sites. Analysis of Fourier transform infrared
  (FTIR) data showed that the degradation rates of the GRSP's compositions
  varied with increasing burial depth, with microbial action and pH possibly
  being the main factors affecting degradation. Values of recalcitrance index
  (RI) showed that the stability of GRSP increased with increasing depth, and
  the contribution of GRSP to soil organic carbon (SOC) also increased. This
  suggests that the burial process plays a role in screening and storing the
  stable components of GRSP. Overall, our findings suggest that the
  concentration and chemical composition of GRSP vary dynamically according to
  habitat and burial processes. In addition, the improved stability of GRSP
  could contribute to carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands.
