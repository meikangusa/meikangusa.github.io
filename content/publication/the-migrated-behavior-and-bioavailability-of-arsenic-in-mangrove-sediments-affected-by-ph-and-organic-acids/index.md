abstract: Batch experiments were conducted to study the migration behavior of
  arsenic (As) and iron (bivalent, trivalent,  and total Fe) of the presence of
  the low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) citric acid, malic acid,
  and  oxalic acid in As-enriched mangrove sediments. The results for
  supernatant As/Fe species were significant according to each LMWOA treatment.
  Significant non-linear correlations were found among As level, pH, and
  acid  dose based on our predictive model. The capacity of LMWOAs to mobilize
  As/Fe species followed the order of  citric acid > malic acid/oxalic acid. The
  supernatant As correlated positively with the LMWOAs dose and negatively
  correlated with the pH. As migration was affected by acid strength, the number
  of carboxyl groups, the  pH and levels of Fe compounds in the sediments. The
  results indicate that LMWOAs can potentially attenuate As  contamination from
  mangrove sediment, allowing for a better understanding of As/Fe behavior in
  the rhizosphere.
