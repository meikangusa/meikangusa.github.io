abstract: "Coal-washing wastewater is the residual produced by the coal
  industry, which may represent a high risk of serious environmental problems
  worldwide. However, prevailing coal-washing treatment processes are hardly
  ideal for achieving the goal of solid–liquid separation due to the
  wastewater’s extremely stable physicochemical properties. This research treats
  the coal-washing wastewater produced by a plant in Northeast China by means of
  the coagulation–flocculation process. The sedimentation ability of different
  coagulant choices and flocculant dosages is tested and analyzed through
  pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. Scanning transmission electron
  microscopy is used to account for the settlement mechanism of flocs, which not
  only explains the characterized effect of coagulants and the flocculant but
  also demonstrates the advantage of using combined coagulates. Using the
  three-dimensional response surface method, an optimized treatment condition of
  1.20 g m(FeCl3): m(CaO) = 1:3 mixed coagulants + 2.00 mL 0.13% polyacrylamide
  flocculant is proposed for 100 mL of selected wastewater. Additionally, the
  relationships between the optimal treatment conditions and the properties of
  wastewater obtained from X-ray energy-dispersive analysis are determined for
  future practical optimization needs."
