abstract: GRSP is widely distributed in coastal wetlands, and there is a
  tendency for it to degrade with increasing burial depth.  However, the dynamic
  changes in the chemical composition and stability of GRSP during the burial
  process are still  unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify the
  chemical composition and accumulation characteristics of GRSP during the
  burial process in the Zhangjiang estuary. In a field study, soil cores to the
  depth of 100 cm were collected in the  estuary from mangrove forests dominated
  by Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, and from mudflat. The
  results  showed that the concentration of GRSP in mangrove forest soil was
  significantly higher than that in the mudflat (p  < 0.05), and the C/N ratio
  of GRSP increased with depth at all sites. Analysis of Fourier transform
  infrared (FTIR)  data showed that the degradation rates of the GRSP's
  compositions varied with increasing burial depth, with microbial  action and
  pH possibly being the main factors affecting degradation. Values of
  recalcitrance index (RI) showed that the  stability of GRSP increased with
  increasing depth, and the contribution of GRSP to soil organic carbon (SOC)
  also increased. This suggests that the burial process plays a role in
  screening and storing the stable components of GRSP.  Overall, our findings
  suggest that the concentration and chemical composition of GRSP vary
  dynamically according  to habitat and burial processes. In addition, the
  improved stability of GRSP could contribute to carbon sequestration  in
  coastal wetlands.
