abstract: "Mutual transformations of rhizospheric arsenic (As) in
  pollution-prone mangrove sediments affected by root exudate oxalate were
  simulated. This study focuses on the effect of oxalate on As release,
  mobilisation, and phase speciation associated with P and Fe was examined under
  anoxic conditions in time-dependent changes. Results showed that oxalate
  addition significantly facilitated As–Fe–P release from As-contaminated
  mangrove sediments. Sediment As formed the adsorptive and the
  carbonate-binding fractionations, facilitating the re-adsorption processes.
  Solution As and As^5+ correlated with NaOH–P positively but with NaHCO_3–P and
  HCl–P negatively. Dominant Fe^3+ (>84%) from the amorphous Fe regulated
  suspension changes and then time-dependent co-precipitation with As and P.
  Sediment P formed strong complexes with Fe oxides and could be substituted for
  As via STEM analysis. Oxalate ligand exchange, competitive adsorption of
  oxalate, and Fe-reduced dissolution are confirmed to involve, allowing for an
  insight As/P/Fe mobilization and fate in mangrove wetland. "
