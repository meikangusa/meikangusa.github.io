abstract: Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), a fundamental precursor in the synthesis of
  heme and chlorophyll, plays a vital role in the biological metabolism and
  biogeochemical cycling in the ocean. PPIX has previously been identified in
  humans, animals, and plants, while so far as we know, there is no measurements
  until now regarding its contents in microbes, and especially in marine
  phytoplankton and bacteria. Here, for the first time, we reported a method of
  determining PPIX in marine microbial cells via acetone extraction followed by
  reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography quantification, in which
  acetone-acetonitrile/water-formic acid buffer was used as a gradient elution
  solvent. The method was optimized with the detection limit of 3.8 ± 1.0 pM,
  and recovery rate of 97.5 ± 1.9%. The structure of the extracted PPIX was
  further confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry as positively associated with
  specific protonated molecules [M + H]+. The method was then successfully
  applied in the determination of PPIX in microbial cells in the water samples
  collected from a median-sized subtropical estuary (the Jiulong River Estuary,
  China). The results showed that PPIX existed widely and ranged from 20 – 170
  ng/L in cells in the water samples. In the whole estuary, cellular PPIX
  generally decreased linearly with increasing salinity. A positive correlation
  of PPIX with particulate organic matter in the estuary suggested of sediment
  suspension and dissolution as its possible source. In addition, a general
  hyperbolic fitting pattern was observed for PPIX against dissolved inorganic
  nitrogen, PO4 3−, and the bacterial abundance (104 – 106 cells/mL) in the
  estuary. Such results indicated that PPIX played a crucial role in linking
  nutrients and the microbial productivity. In summary, we developed a new
  technique of quantifying cellular PPIX in water samples and confirmed the wide
  existence of cellular PPIX in natural waters. The data from Jiulong River
  estuary further suggest that the contents of cellular PPIX be enhanced with
  the nutrient supply from riverine inputs and sediment suspensions, which
  thereafter dictate the productivity of phytoplankton and bacteria in coastal
  waters.
