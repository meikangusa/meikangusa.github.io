abstract: Mangrove wetlands are subjected to pollution due to anthropogenic
  activities. Mangrove fitness is mainly  determined by root exudates and
  microorganisms activities belowground, but the mechanisms are not yet
  well  known. Rhizospheric interactions among mangrove sediments,
  microorganisms and root exudates were simulated. In particular,
  low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA), were examined to explore the
  metal(loid)s  rhizospheric dynamics via batch experiments. Using a combination
  of comparative sterilised and unsterilised  sediments, LMWOA extracts and
  sediments constituents were examined. Factors such as the solution pH,
  dissolved organic carbon (DOC), arsenic and iron species and metal(loid)s in
  the aqueous phase were evaluated. The  results show that on an average, the As
  decreased by 68.3 % and 42.1 % under citric and malic acid
  treatments,  respectively, after sterilisation. In contrast, the As content
  increased by 29.6 % under oxalic acid treatment.  Microorganisms probably
  facilitate sediment As release in the presence of citric and malic acids but
  suppress As  mobilisation in the presence of oxalic acid. Fe, Mn and Al were
  significantly (p < 0.05) positively correlated with  the trace metal(loid)s
  (Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Ba, Cd and As). The solution pH was negatively
  correlated with the  solution As. Both DOC and pH reach the peaks at the end
  of all treatments. The As absorptionâ€“desorption dynamics are closely linked to
  proton consumption, Fe-Mn-Al sedimentation of ageing performance and
  organic  ligand complexation. The study provides an insight into the
  rhizospheric processes of microbial involvement and gives an enlightening
  understanding of the metal(loid)s redeployment for plant adaptation in
  mangrove  wetlands.
