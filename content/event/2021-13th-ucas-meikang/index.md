abstract: Arsenic (As) contamination in mangrove wetlands has become a major
  concern. However, the impact of As on mangroves and the rhizospheric mechanism
  remains unclarified. In this study, various properties and responses of
  mangrove seedlings were investigated after exposure to arsenite (As3+). The
  results indicate that low-level As promoted the secretion of
  Low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOA, 4.5-6.59 mg/kg root in dry weight)
  and Fe plaque formation in their rhizospheres. Citric, oxalic, and malic acid
  were the three main components (84.3%- 86.8%). Low-levels (5 and 10 μmol/L)
  also inhibited the rate of radial oxygen loss (ROL) but increased the
  accumulation of plant As (stem> leaf> root) and plaque As (0.23-1.13 mg/kg
  root in dry weight). We selected model LMWOAs to further examine As migration
  and speciation over time in As-enriched sediments (0, 20 and 40 mg/kg). The
  results reveal that LMWOAs promoted sediment As mobilisation and followed the
  order of citric acid > malic acid > oxalic acid. The hydrolysis and
  precipitation of Fe3+ and the complexation with organic ligand led to aqueous
  As and Fe sedimentation and, conversely, increased solution pH and re
  translocated free As. The tolerance mechanisms include lowering ROL,
  translocating As and releasing LMWOAs to reduce its toxicity, and faciliting
  the fixation in sediment of oxidised As. The present study highlights the fact
  that mangroves are potentially favourable for As phytoextraction, removal and
  detoxification.
