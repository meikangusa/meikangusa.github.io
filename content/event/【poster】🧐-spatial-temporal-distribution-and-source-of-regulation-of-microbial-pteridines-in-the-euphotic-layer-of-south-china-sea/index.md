abstract: "Originally discovered in photoautotrophic cyanobacteria, microbial
  pteridines are precursors involved in the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen
  cycles, and participate in phototaxis signal transduction (as photoreceptor),
  photochemical redox reaction, solar energy capture and ultraviolet radiation
  protection as coenzymes or cofactors. In this study, the vertical distribution
  of biogenic microbial pteridines in the euphotic layer of the South China Sea
  Basin was reported for the first time, and the marine environmental
  concentrations of neopterin (NP), biopterin (BP) and isoxanthopterin (IP) were
  determined by high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence detector
  (HPLC-FLD), and the detection limits were NP: 0.48 nM, BP: 0.72 nM, and
  IP：0.22 nM respectively. The results showed that the pteridines was mainly
  enriched in the surface layer (within 100 m), and the subsurface layer (at
  100-200 m) was mostly below the detection limits. Noteworthily, NP was not
  detected in all samples, and the concentration of water column profile
  distribution of BP (0.01–0.6 pM) and IP (0.01–3 pM) was strongly negatively
  correlated with the nutrients at each station, indicating biomass-dependent
  attributes. Around the maximum layer depth of chlorophyll a, it was found that
  the corresponding depth IP content response value was high, and the
  geographical distribution of BP and IP was positively correlated with the
  abundance of cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, which may
  indicate that Synechococcus is an important source of BP contribution. In
  terms of seasonal distribution, the abundance of pteridines in the surface
  layer in summer was significantly higher than that measured in spring. The
  detection of pteridines in euphotic layer has the potential to reveal the
  biogeochemical cycling processes occurring in marine microbial communities and
  their biological roles."
