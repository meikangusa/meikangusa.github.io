title: "ü§ì„ÄêORAL„Äë Spatial-temporal Distribution and   Regulatory Mechanism of
  Novel Biomarker   Microbial Pterins in Xiamen Bay  "
abstract: "Pterins are essential biomolecules widely conserved in diverse
  microbes. First discovered as enzymatic cofactors, pterins participate in
  countless enzymatic reactions such as photoreceptor signal transduction and
  redox. Pterins are involved in light energy capture and UV protection as
  pigments as well. In this study, pterins were widely distributed in
  microorganisms in the Jiulong River Estuary and nearshore seawaters, but the
  abundance and composition of microorganisms in different habitats determine
  the difference in the concentration of pterins. Estuarine sediments tend to
  conserve reduced DNP and biosynthetic precursor NP but are more likely to
  retain BP and final product IP in the waterbody. Microbial pterins in the
  summer (Flood season: 0.23-136 pM) were significantly higher than in the
  autumn (Dry season: 0.92-16.9 pM). Aqueous microbial pterins were related to
  plankton abundance and have favorable coupling with chlorophyll a (Chl-a),
  indicating higher productivity of estuarine diatoms driven by estuarine
  nutrients and particulate organic carbon inputs facilitated the higher
  concentration of pterins. In summer, photoautotrophic phytoplankton was the
  major sources of pterins; while the proportion of heterotrophic prokaryotes
  contributing to pterins have increased in autumn with low productivity. In
  comparison, sediment pterins were about three orders of magnitude higher than
  in the seawaters, and the reduced form DNP (44-60.8 nM) in the sediment was
  3-10 times that of other pterins. There was no significant difference in the
  distribution of pterins between seasons, mainly due to the decomposition of
  bacteria in the sediment, implying biodegradation was an important
  supplementary source of pterins. Therefore, microbial pterin molecules have
  the potential to be biomarkers for revealing marine biogeochemical cycles and
  primary production processes."
