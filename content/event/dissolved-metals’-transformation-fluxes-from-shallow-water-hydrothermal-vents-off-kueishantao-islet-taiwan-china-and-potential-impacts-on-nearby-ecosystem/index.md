  Abstract: Shallow water hydrothermal vents are one of important sources of
  trace elements in the ocean, which potentially impact coastal ecosystem. We
  investigated two shallow water hydrothermal vents (white and yellow vents) for
  siderophile and chalcophile elements (Fe/Mn/V/Cu/Mo) off Kueishantao islet,
  Taiwan, China. The results show that dissolved metals were generally lower in
  the yellow vent than that in the white vent. Especially waters inside the
  white vent was enriched with dissolved metals such as Mn and Fe. High
  abundance of sulfide particles was identified both in hydrothermal plumes. The
  fluxes of dissolved elements was estimated from the KSI hydrothermal vents
  were as the following annually: 0.10–1.23 kg Fe, 0.08–28 kg Mn, 33.4–306 g V,
  2.89–77.7 g Cu, and 54.3–664 g Mo. In summary, our study identified a large
  number of acid-reducible sulfides, ore-forming metals in these shallow water
  hydrothermal vents along with those highly toxic and acidic hydrothermal
  fluids. The unique ecosystem nearby further suggests such release of chemical
  substances from these vents play a key role in moderating the evolution of
  marine environment nearby.
