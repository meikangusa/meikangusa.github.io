abstract: "Pterins are fundamental in biological growth and functioning
  including coloration,  metabolic modulation, and signaling transduction.
  Previously, pterins have been  specifically studied as they are involved in
  nutrient cycles, detoxification, and  unconventional utilization of carbon and
  nitrogen sources. Currently, several types of  pterins have been reported
  existing in biological cells. For example, biopterin (BPT)  could be produced
  during metabolic processes of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP),  which has been
  reported in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Neopterin (NPT: BPT  intermediate) and
  (iso)xanthopterin (IPT: BPT final metabolite) are also produced from  the
  metabolism of GTP. Until now there is only one report regarding BPT
  measurements  in coastal phytoplankton (by Mengqiu Shi, 2019). Nobody has
  reported any  measurements of other pterins in phytoplankton, and no data is
  available so far  regarding the measurements of dissolved pterins in natural
  waters. Currently, we tested  protocols of measuring different pterins in
  natural waters, the detection limits (sample  volume: 20 μL) for each pterin
  were as the following: NPT, 120 ng/L; BPT, 170 ng/L;  and IPT, 40 ng/L. And we
  verified the BPT molecule by using the LC-MS technique.  We will continue
  working on the protocol and further test samples taken from coastal  waters
  and open oceans."
