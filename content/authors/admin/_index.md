I am interested in trace metals, marine microorganisms, and low-weight-molecular compounds in microbial ecology. Now I am working on the determination of marine trace compounds (dissolved and particulate) in seawaters. These compounds include but are not limited to low-weight-molecular organic acids, vitamins, and pteridines, etc.

Anyway, my research interests include Marine sciences, Fitness, Golf, Cooking, Calligraphy, Poeming and maybe programmable in the future.
