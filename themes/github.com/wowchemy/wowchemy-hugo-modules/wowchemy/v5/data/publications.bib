	abstract = {Batch experiments were conducted to study the migration behavior of arsenic (As) and iron (bivalent, trivalent, and total Fe) of the presence of the low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) citric acid, malic acid, and oxalic acid in As-enriched mangrove sediments. The results for supernatant As/Fe species were signiﬁcant according to each LMWOA treatment. Signiﬁcant non-linear correlations were found among As level, pH, and acid dose based on our predictive model. The capacity of LMWOAs to mobilize As/Fe species followed the order of citric acid {\textgreater} malic acid/oxalic acid. The supernatant As correlated positively with the LMWOAs dose and negatively correlated with the pH. As migration was aﬀected by acid strength, the number of carboxyl groups, the pH and levels of Fe compounds in the sediments. The results indicate that LMWOAs can potentially attenuate As contamination from mangrove sediment, allowing for a better understanding of As/Fe behavior in the rhizosphere.},

	abstract = {Increasing arsenic (As) pollution is posing potential endangerment to mangrove wetland ecosystems. Mangrove phytoextraction, translocation, and responses to As exposure must be urgently addressed. In this study, the growth and physiological response of Kandelia obovata seedlings were examined after addition of 25−200 mg kg−1 As under sediment culture conditions. Results showed that the seedling morphological variations were not signiﬁcant below 100 mg kg−1 compared to the control group, indicating superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase synergetic interaction to resist the As exposure. High As concentrations (150–200 mg kg−1) inhibited the seedling growth accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in malondialdehyde content and decrease in activities of antioxidant enzymes. Toxicity symptoms and mortality appeared in 200 mg kg−1 As, presumably because the plant reached the limit of As tolerance. Besides, As accumulated mainly in roots, accounting for 87.04–97.85\% of the total As, and the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) was {\textgreater}100\%. However, the BCF and translocation factor (TF) in stems and leaves were below unity, illustrating a weak capacity of transferring As to aerial parts of the seedlings. Overall, K. obovata is a potential remediated species in polluted coastal wetlands due to high phytoextraction capacity and high tolerance to As exposure.},

	abstract = {GRSP is widely distributed in coastal wetlands, and there is a tendency for it to degrade with increasing burial depth. However, the dynamic changes in the chemical composition and stability of GRSP during the burial process are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify the chemical composition and accumulation characteristics of GRSP during the burial process in the Zhangjiang estuary. In a ﬁeld study, soil cores to the depth of 100 cm were collected in the estuary from mangrove forests dominated by Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, and from mudﬂat. The results showed that the concentration of GRSP in mangrove forest soil was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the mudﬂat (p {\textless} 0.05), and the C/N ratio of GRSP increased with depth at all sites. Analysis of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) data showed that the degradation rates of the GRSP's compositions varied with increasing burial depth, with microbial action and pH possibly being the main factors affecting degradation. Values of recalcitrance index (RI) showed that the stability of GRSP increased with increasing depth, and the contribution of GRSP to soil organic carbon (SOC) also increased. This suggests that the burial process plays a role in screening and storing the stable components of GRSP. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that the concentration and chemical composition of GRSP vary dynamically according to habitat and burial processes. In addition, the improved stability of GRSP could contribute to carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands.},
